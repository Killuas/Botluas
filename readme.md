# Voice Channel Join Sounds
The bot will join voice chat and play a specific sound clip when certain people join. This has to be manually done by adding the corresponding mp3 you want to play into the folder and editing the json file in the /VoiceClips folder to have the correct user ID and mp3 name. The bot will leave voice chat once all voice channels are empty.
